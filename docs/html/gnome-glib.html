<h4 class="node-heading">gnome glib</h4>

<p>When using the scheme (gnome gtk) bindings of guile-gnome with guile,
in order to provide await semantics on gtk+ callbacks it will normally
be necessary to use the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; procedures provided by
the a-sync procedure in the <a href="coroutines.html#coroutines">(a-sync coroutines)</a>
module directly (calling &rsquo;resume&rsquo; in the gtk+ callback when ready, and
waiting on that callback using &rsquo;await&rsquo;).  However when launching
timeouts, file watches or idle events on the glib main loop,
convenience procedures are possible similar to those provided for the
event loop in the <a href="event-loop.html#event-loop">(a-sync event-loop)</a> module.  These
are set out below.
</p>
<p>Note that the g-idle-add procedure in guile-gnome is suspect - there
appears to be a garbage collection issue, and if you call the
procedure often enough in a single or multi-threaded program it will
eventually segfault.  g-io-add-watch is also broken in guile-gnome, so
this library uses its own glib-add-watch procedure which is exported
publicly in case it is useful to users.
</p>
<p>All the other scheme files provided by this library are by default
compiled by this library to bytecode.  That is not the case with this
module, so as not to create a hard dependency on guile-gnome.
</p>
<p>Including this module will automatically enable suspendable ports in
order to support the await-glib-read-suspendable,
await-glib-write-suspendable and await-glib-getline procedures.  To
disable suspendable ports again, uninstall-suspendable-ports! can be
called, but this means that those procedures can no longer be used
while suspendable ports are disabled.  In addition, any port using
those procedures must be made non-blocking using fcntl as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(fcntl [port] F_SETFL (logior O_NONBLOCK
                      (fcntl [port] F_GETFL)))
</pre></div>

<p>The (a-sync gnome-glib) module provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-await_002dglib_002dtask_002din_002dthread"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-glib-task-in-thread</strong> <em>await resume thunk [handler]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure which will run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in its own
thread, and then post an event to the default glib main loop when
&rsquo;thunk&rsquo; has finished.  This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; in the default
glib main loop and will return the thunk&rsquo;s return value.  It is
intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  If
the optional &rsquo;handler&rsquo; argument is provided, then it will be run in
the default glib main loop if &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; throws and its return value will
be the return value of this procedure; otherwise the program will
terminate if an unhandled exception propagates out of &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;.
&rsquo;handler&rsquo; should take the same arguments as a guile catch handler
(this is implemented using catch).
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs, where the
result of calling &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; will be received.  As mentioned above, the
thunk itself will run in its own thread.
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the worker thread starts), which shouldn&rsquo;t
happen unless memory is exhausted or pthread has run out of resources.
Exceptions arising during execution of the task, if not caught by a
handler procedure, will terminate the program.  Exceptions thrown by
the handler procedure will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.
</p>
<p>This procedure uses g-idle-add: see the introductory remarks about
that.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of await-glib-task-in-thread:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))

<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for acting asynchronously on values
yielded by generator procedures.  The &rsquo;generator&rsquo; argument is a
procedure taking one argument, namely a yield argument (see the
documentation on the make-iterator procedure for further details).

its own worker thread, and whenever &rsquo;generator&rsquo; yields a value will

unhandled exception propagates out of &rsquo;generator&rsquo;.  &rsquo;handler&rsquo; should
take the same arguments as a guile catch handler (this is implemented
using catch).
</p>
<p>This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; and will return when the generator has
finished or, if &rsquo;handler&rsquo; is provided, upon the generator throwing an
exception.  This procedure will return #f if the generator completes
normally, or &rsquo;guile-a-sync-thread-error if the generator throws an

is reserved to the implementation and should not be yielded by the

<dt><a name="index-glib_002dadd_002dwatch"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>glib-add-watch</strong> <em>ioc cond func [context]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure replaces guile-gnome&rsquo;s g-io-add-watch procedure, which
won&rsquo;t compile.  It attaches a watch on a g-io-channel object to the
main context provided, or if none is provided, to the default glib
main context (the main program loop).  It returns a glib ID which can
be passed subsequently to the g-source-remove procedure.  It should be
possible to call this procedure in any thread.
</p>
<p>&rsquo;ioc&rsquo; is the g-io-condition object to which the watch is to be
attached, and &rsquo;cond&rsquo; is a list of symbols (being &rsquo;in, &rsquo;out, &rsquo;pri,
&rsquo;hup, &rsquo;err and &rsquo;nval) comprising the events for which the watch is
established.
</p>
<p>&rsquo;func&rsquo; is executed when an event occurs, and takes two arguments:
first the g-io-channel object to which the watch has been attached,
and second a g-io-condition object indicating the watch condition
which has been met (note: the interface for g-io-condition objects is
broken in guile-gnome at present).  The watch is ended either by
&rsquo;func&rsquo; returning #f, or by applying g-source-remove to the return
value of this procedure.  Otherwise the watch will continue.
</p>
<p>File watches in guile-gnome are implemented using a GIOChannel object,
and unfortunately GIOChannel support in guile-gnome is decaying.  The
only procedure that guile-gnome provides to read from a GIOChannel
object is g-io-channel-read-line, which does not work.  One is
therefore usually left with having to read from a guile port (whose
underlying file descriptor is &rsquo;fd&rsquo;) using guile&rsquo;s port input
procedures, but this has its own difficulties, which means that one of
the following approaches should be adopted (i) the port has to be
unbuffered (say by using the open-file or fdopen procedure with the
&rsquo;0&rsquo; mode option or the R6RS open-file-input-port procedure with a
buffer-mode of none, or by calling setvbuf), or (ii) &rsquo;proc&rsquo; must deal
with everything in the port&rsquo;s buffer by calling drain-input, or by
looping on char-ready? before returning, or (iii) the port&rsquo;s ordinary
input procedures should be used with suspendable ports using the
await-glib-read-suspendable procedure.  This is because otherwise, if
the port is buffered, once the port is read from there may be further
characters in the buffer to be dealt with even though the GIOChannel
watch does not trigger because there is nothing new to make the file
descriptor ready for reading.
